## Notes Before Proceeding
Referencing our documentations, our class implementations are located as follows:
- boundary classes are located in frontend/boundaryClasses
- control classes are located in backend/src/controlClasses
- entity classes are located in backend/src/entityClasses    


Our app runs on React Native, our NodeJS API is hosted on render and our PostgreSQL database is hosted on heroku.
